# RecipeApp

This project is designed to help me learn the ins and outs of Angular. As I make progress, I will update this `ReadMe.md` with things I have learned and applied here.

- Preparing the structure of an application
- Building Components using the Angular CLI
- Building Components Manually using app.module
- Exporting classes with Models
- Built-in Angular Directives: `*ngFor`, `*ngIf`, `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, and two-way databinding with `ngModel`
